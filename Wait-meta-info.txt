Wait gets its meta information from each individual module.  It also
uses the information which goes to build the modules list.  It
directly reads from the POD documentation.  When we try to map this
onto module distribution files, we can mostly read from the "Main"
module of the distribution.  That is to say the one which has a name
matching the distribution file's name.

This would give the following

'synopsis' - summary 

'name' - ignored - the package name is needed

'bugs', - hmm

'author', - this can help map to the author but it tends to be verbose
	  where the author field in most package formats is a single 
	  URL (normally mailto)

'example', - not relevant

'description' - description

'environment' - not relevant.  

IMHO it seems that the most valuable is the description.  The best
source for other information is the modules list, however, this is
(deliberately) incomplete becuase it doesn't include the
non-registered modules.  

From the modules list we can map

id - author

description - summary

deveopment stage - i..M not implemented but interesting
		 S - probably should not be packaged separately from perl

support level - not implemented but interesting - though maybe any
	binary package comes with a fixed level of support from the 
	packager???
